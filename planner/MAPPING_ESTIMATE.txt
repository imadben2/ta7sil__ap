ESTIMATED IMAGE → DAY MAPPING FOR PATCH 05
================================================

Based on analysis:
- Total images: 55
- Total days in program: 100
- Pattern seems to be ~1.8 days per image on average

ASSUMPTION: Day 57 starts around image 44

Estimated mapping:
Image 44 → Day 57
Image 45 → Day 58
Image 46 → Day 59
Image 47 → Day 60
Image 48 → Day 61
Image 49 → Day 62
Image 50 → Day 63 (Week 9 Reward)
Image 51 → Day 64
Image 52 → Day 65
Image 53 → Day 66
Image 54 → Day 67
Image 55 → Day 68

⚠️ PROBLEM: We need Days 57-70 (14 days) but only have images 44-55 (12 images)

POSSIBLE EXPLANATIONS:
1. Some images contain 2 days
2. Day numbering doesn't match image numbers
3. Starting point is different

MANUAL VERIFICATION REQUIRED:
Please open these images and tell me which day is in each:
- Image 41
- Image 42
- Image 43
- Image 44
- Image 45

This will help determine the correct pattern.
